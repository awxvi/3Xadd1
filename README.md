# 3X+1
## This is an algorithm in which if a number is odd, then it is 3x'd and +1'd, if it's even it is /2'd

With this mathmatical algorithm, when the number reaches 16, it goes to 8, then 4 where a loop begins:

<br>

<li> 4 / 2 = 2 </li>
<li> 2 / 2 = 1 </li>
<li> 1 * 3 + 1 = 4 </li>

<br>

and it repeats.
